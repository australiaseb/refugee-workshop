# Refugee Workshop

This repository is the base for the Hands-On part of kartenmacherei's workshop for refugees. 
In this workshop we invite up to 10 refugees for 5 weeks into our office and explain what apprenticeship in germany means and what makes it special at kartenmacherei.
Every week we give for 1.5 hours insight into apprentice topics like HTML, CSS or git. 
Afterwards the participants have the opportunity to foster their learning in a practical Hands-On workshop.
